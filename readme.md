## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## Dear Mam
First of all I just ran a command on my project root folder docker-compose -v by using cmd, it checks the version of docker-compose on my machine.
Secondly, same I ran a command named docker -v, it checks the version of docker on my machine.
after that, I ran a command named docker-compose up and this command started building frontend, backend and database of my project.
